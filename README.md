## ðŸ’¡ What Are We Building?

The goal is to create a *Data Analyst Assistant* that allows users to:
- Ask novel questions about their data in natural language
- Automatically generate insights, visualizations, and summaries
- Seamlessly connect and merge multiple data sources
- Suggest data transformations and dataset combinations
- Provide traceable, explainable answers via an AI agent that reasons over the data
- Allow users to explore, refine, and save analysis workflows interactively
