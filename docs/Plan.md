# Project Implementation Plan: Data Analyst / Query Bot Prototype (Detailed)

This plan outlines the phased implementation of the Data Analyst / Query Bot prototype using Python, FastAPI, SQLModel, and SQLite, based on the generated design documents and further detailed using sequential thinking.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Backend (SQLite/SQLModel)

-   [ ] Initialize a new Python project directory (Easy)
-   [ ] Create a virtual environment and activate it (Easy)
-   [ ] Install core dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `sqlmodel`, `aiosqlite` (Easy)
-   [ ] Create `main.py` with a basic FastAPI app instance (Easy)
-   [ ] Create `database.py` to handle database connection setup for SQLite using SQLModel (Medium)
-   [ ] Define SQLModel classes for the `Query` entity in `models.py` based on `docs/database_design.md` (Medium)
-   [ ] Implement basic CRUD functions (`create_query`, `get_query`, `update_query`) in `crud.py` using SQLModel sessions (Medium)
-   [ ] Integrate database session dependency into FastAPI (Medium)
-   [ ] (Optional) Set up Alembic for database migrations (Medium)
-   [ ] (Optional) Create initial migration script for the `Query` table (Medium)

## Phase 2: API Endpoints and Basic Query Handling

-   [ ] Create `schemas.py` and define Pydantic models (`QueryCreate`, `QueryResponse`) based on `docs/api_design_specification.md` (Easy)
-   [ ] Create `api/endpoints/query.py` to define query-related endpoints (Easy)
-   [ ] Implement the `POST /query/` endpoint:
    -   Accept `QueryCreate` model in the request body (Medium)
    -   Use CRUD function to create a new `Query` entry in the database with status "Pending" (Medium)
    -   Return the created `Query` object using `QueryResponse` model (Medium)
-   [ ] Implement the `GET /query/{query_id}` endpoint:
    -   Accept `query_id` as a path parameter (Easy)
    -   Use CRUD function to retrieve the `Query` entry by ID (Medium)
    -   Return the `Query` object using `QueryResponse` model (Medium)
    -   Add error handling for `query_id` not found (Medium)
-   [ ] Include the query router in `main.py` (Easy)

## Phase 3: Natural Language to SQL Translation (Core Logic)

-   [ ] Research and evaluate different approaches for NL to SQL translation:
    -   Using a pre-trained LLM via an MCP tool (e.g., the provided PostgreSQL or SQLite MCP servers if they offer translation capabilities, or another LLM server) (Complex)
    -   Using a dedicated NL to SQL library (Complex)
    -   Implementing custom translation logic (Complex)
-   [ ] Select the most suitable approach based on research and project constraints (Complex)
-   [ ] Implement the chosen query translation logic in `services.py` (Complex)
    -   This service should take natural language text and database schema information as input.
    -   It should output a valid SQL query.
-   [ ] Modify the `POST /query/` endpoint to call the translation service asynchronously after saving the initial query (Medium)
-   [ ] Implement a background task or worker to handle the asynchronous translation process (Medium)
-   [ ] Update the `Query` entry in the database with the `generated_sql_query` and update the `status` (e.g., to "Translating" or "Translation Complete") (Medium)
-   [ ] Add error handling for translation failures (Medium)

## Phase 4: SQL Execution and Results Retrieval

-   [ ] Implement the logic in `services.py` to execute the `generated_sql_query` against the SQLite database (Medium)
    -   This service should take the SQL query as input.
    -   It should return the query results in a structured format (e.g., list of dictionaries).
-   [ ] Modify the background task/worker to call the SQL execution service after successful translation (Medium)
-   [ ] Update the `Query` entry in the database with the `query_results` (serialized, e.g., to JSON string) and update the `status` (e.g., to "Executing" or "Completed") (Medium)
-   [ ] Add error handling for SQL execution failures, updating the `status` to "Failed" and storing error details (Medium)
-   [ ] Ensure the `GET /query/{query_id}` endpoint correctly returns the `query_results` when the status is "Completed" (Easy)

## Phase 5: Basic Frontend (Optional for Prototype)

-   [ ] Create an `index.html` file with a form containing a text input for the query and a button (Easy)
-   [ ] Create a `style.css` file for basic styling (Easy)
-   [ ] Create a `script.js` file for frontend logic (Medium)
-   [ ] In `script.js`, add an event listener to the form submission (Medium)
-   [ ] Prevent default form submission and send an asynchronous POST request to `/query/` with the natural language query (Medium)
-   [ ] Handle the response from the POST request, potentially displaying a loading indicator (Medium)
-   [ ] Periodically poll the `GET /query/{query_id}` endpoint to check the status and retrieve results (Complex)
-   [ ] Display the query results in a user-friendly format on the page (Medium)
-   [ ] Add basic error handling for frontend API interactions (Medium)

## Phase 6: Refinement and Testing

-   [ ] Write unit tests for database CRUD functions (`crud.py`) (Medium)
-   [ ] Write unit tests for service functions (`services.py`), mocking external dependencies like the translation logic or database execution (Medium)
-   [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints (`api/endpoints/query.py`) (Medium)
-   [ ] Refactor code for improved readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices (Medium)
-   [ ] Review and update all markdown documentation (`docs/`, `docs-tech/`) to reflect the implemented details (Easy)
-   [ ] Add comments and docstrings to the code (Easy)
-   [ ] Prepare a `Dockerfile` for containerization of the backend application (Medium)
-   [ ] Write a brief deployment guide (Medium)
