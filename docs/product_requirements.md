# Product Requirements Document: Data Analyst / Query Bot

## Elevator Pitch

A natural language query bot that allows users to interact with a PostgreSQL database using plain English, making data analysis accessible to non-technical users and streamlining data exploration for technical users.

## Who is this app for

This app is for business analysts, data scientists, researchers, and anyone who needs to extract information from a PostgreSQL database without writing SQL queries. It is also for developers who want a faster way to explore data during development.

## Functional Requirements

-   Connect to a specified PostgreSQL database.
-   Accept natural language queries from the user.
-   Translate natural language queries into valid SQL queries.
-   Execute the generated SQL queries against the connected database.
-   Display the results of the SQL queries in a user-friendly format.
-   Handle potential errors during query translation or execution.
-   Provide feedback to the user on the query translation process.

## User Stories

-   As a business analyst, I want to ask questions about sales data in plain English so I can get quick insights without relying on the IT department.
-   As a data scientist, I want to quickly explore the structure and content of a new dataset by asking natural language questions.
-   As a researcher, I want to retrieve specific data points from a database for my study without needing to learn SQL.
-   As a developer, I want to test my database schema by querying it with natural language during the development phase.

## User Interface

The user interface will be a simple chat-like interface where users can type their natural language queries and see the results displayed below.

### Layout Structure

A single-page application with a prominent input field for typing queries and a display area for showing results.

### Core Components

A text input field, a submit button, and a results display area (potentially a table or formatted text).

### Interaction patterns

Users will type a query and press enter or click a submit button. The system will process the query and display the results asynchronously.

### Visual Design Elements & Color Scheme

A clean and minimalist design with a focus on readability of query results. A simple color scheme, perhaps using shades of blue and gray.

### Mobile, Web App, Desktop considerations

The initial prototype will focus on a web application interface. Mobile responsiveness will be a consideration for future iterations. A desktop application is not planned for the initial phase.

### Typography

A clear and readable sans-serif font for text input and results display.

### Accessibility

Basic accessibility considerations will be taken into account for input fields and result display to ensure usability for users with disabilities.
