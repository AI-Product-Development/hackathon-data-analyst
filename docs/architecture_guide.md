h# Architecture Guide: Data Analyst / Query Bot Prototype

## 1. Selected Architecture Pattern

The selected architecture pattern for the initial prototype is a **Monolithic** architecture.

This pattern was chosen for its simplicity and ease of development for a prototype. It allows for rapid iteration and reduces initial complexity compared to distributed systems like microservices. While a microservices or serverless architecture might be considered for future scaling, the monolithic approach is suitable for validating the core functionality of the Data Analyst / Query Bot.

## 2. State Management

### Frontend State Management

For the frontend (assuming a modern JavaScript framework like React or Vue for future implementation, though not explicitly detailed in prompts), state management could be handled using built-in mechanisms like React Hooks and Context API for simpler state, or a library like Redux or Vuex for more complex global state. For the prototype, minimal frontend state is expected, primarily managing the input query and displaying results.

### Backend State Management

Backend state will be primarily managed within the FastAPI application. Database session management for SQLite will be handled using SQLModel's capabilities, likely involving dependency injection to provide a database session to endpoint functions.

## 3. Technical Stack

### Frontend

The prompts did not specify a frontend framework. For a potential future implementation, a framework like React, Vue, or Angular could be used. UI libraries like Material UI or Ant Design could accelerate development. A component-based strategy would be employed for building the user interface.

### Backend

-   **Language/Framework:** Python / FastAPI
-   **Database (Initial Prototype):** SQLite
-   **ORM:** SQLModel
-   **Caching layers:** Not planned for the initial prototype.

### Authentication

Authentication is not explicitly detailed in the prompts for the core query bot functionality. If user management were required in the future, OAuth2, JWT, Clerk, or Firebase Auth could be considered. For the prototype, we will assume no authentication is required for the core query feature.

### Payments (if applicable)

Not applicable for the core query bot functionality.

### Key Integrations

The primary integration will be with the PostgreSQL database (though the prototype uses SQLite). Future integrations might include analytics or monitoring services.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization Flow

Authentication and authorization are not part of the initial prototype's core functionality based on the provided prompts. If implemented in the future, a standard flow involving user registration, login, JWT token issuance upon successful authentication, and token validation on subsequent requests would be used. Role-based access control (RBAC) would be implemented if different levels of access to data or features are required.

## 5. High-Level Route Design

Based on the core functional requirement of accepting natural language queries and returning results, a minimal set of API endpoints is expected for the prototype.

-   **Frontend Routes/Pages:** A single page for the query interface.
-   **Major Backend API Endpoint Categories:**
    *   `/query/`: Endpoint(s) for submitting natural language queries and receiving results.

## 6. API Design Philosophy

The API will follow a **RESTful** philosophy where appropriate, although the primary interaction is a single query submission. Versioning is not planned for the prototype. Error handling will involve returning appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages in the response body.

## 7. Database Design Overview

The initial prototype will use **SQLite** as the database, managed by **SQLModel**. The database will store information relevant to the query bot, which might include user data (if authentication is added later), query history, or metadata about connected databases. The detailed schema will be defined by the Data Architect using SQLModel classes.

## 8. Deployment & Infrastructure Overview

The target hosting environment for the prototype is not specified. For a simple Python/FastAPI application, options like Heroku, Render, or a basic VPS could be used. A simple CI/CD approach could involve automated testing and deployment upon code commits.
